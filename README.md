# Getting and Cleaning Data - Tidy Data Course Project

This is the R code, documentation and the resulting tidy data file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera - the Tidy Data project.

## Raw data for operation

The raw data that is used is [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

This raw data is not included into the repository and must be manually copied to the raw_data/ subfolder of the working directory.

## Files in the repository

`CodeBook.md` describes data, variables and transformations that the script performed on the data.

`run_analysis.R` is the actual script that performs the analysis of the raw data and cleans it.

`tidyData.txt` is the result of the project and contains the dataset of averages for each needed variable.
